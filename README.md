# dev-environment
This are config files and install scripts for a number of programs that I often use. It mostly sets up a python development environment with vim. At the moment it contains

- .bashrc
- .vimrc + ftplugin commands for vim
- install script for vim8 (requires sudo - vim8 needed for asynchronous linting)
